subtitle:    ~ 400 - 300 BCE
from:        -350
to:          -350 
short:       It is not clear from the available historic texts and archaeology whether the watermill originates in Egypt, Persia, India, Greece, or regions in-between; usage within just a few decades of each other's cultures in the 4th to 3rd centuries BCE is documented over a large swath of Eurasia.
