On 12 April 1961, 6:07 am UTC, the Vostok 3KA-3 (Vostok 1) spacecraft with Gagarin aboard was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. The five first-stage engines fired until the first separation event, when the four side boosters fell away leaving on the core engine. The core stage then separated while the rocket was in a suborbital trajectory, and the upper stage carried it to orbit. Once the upper stage finished firing, it separated from the spacecraft. The spacecraft orbited for 108 minutes before returning to Earth, landing in Kazakhstan.:219 As planned, during descent Gagarin ejected from the capsule and parachuted to the ground. Gagarin thus became both the first human to travel into space, and the first to orbit the Earth. His call sign was Kedr (Russian: Кедр, Siberian pine or Cedar).
