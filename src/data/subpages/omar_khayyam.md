Persian mathematician, astronomer, and poet.


Here are some of his famous [rubaiyat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam):

. . .

> Drink wine. This is life eternal. This is all that youth will give you. It is the season for wine, roses and drunken friends. Be happy for this moment. This moment is your life.

. . .

> To wisely live your life, you don't need to know much  
> Just remember two main rules for the beginning:  
> You better starve, than eat whatever  
> And better be alone, than with whoever.
